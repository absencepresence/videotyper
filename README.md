###Background 

On Nov 4th, CK emailed me 
"do you know anyone who can make me a very quick app where i can use textedit while my camera is in use? my face would show up in the background with large text typing across my face." 

I made a rough prototype and then refined it over the weekend of Nov 6~7. 


Here are some more things to work on. 

1. change fonts, size, bold, italic, underline, colors 
2. show CK's video feed on the curator's laptop
6. work offline 
7. change alignment of the text to the left, right, center
